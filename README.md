# HOS
A webfrontend application which can be used to basically visualize Quotes in _MoSQL_ Format.

### Specification of MoSQL
\<_MoSQL_\> ::= \<_Date in `dd.mm`-Format_\> `:` \<_QUOTE-Origin_\> `:` \<_QUOTE-Content_\> `:` \<_QUOTE-Context_\>

As colon (`:`) is used as a terminal symbol, a simple representation of colon in one of those nonterminals can be done with a simple replacement of `:` through `::`.

# HOS - Hall of Shame
A webfrontend application which can be used to basically visualize Quotes in _MoSQL_ Format.

### Specification of MoSQL
\<_MoSQL_\> ::= \<_Date in `dd.mm`-Format_\> `:` \<_QUOTE-Origin_\> `:` \<_QUOTE-Content_\> `:` \<_QUOTE-Context_\>

As colon (`:`) is used as a terminal symbol, a simple representation of colon in one of those nonterminals can be done with a simple replacement of `:` through `::`.

The present lack of a year specification in _MoSQL_ is not a bug, it's a feature. Just as Unix choosed _01-01-1970_ we did the _01-01-2017_ as our holy year 'cause it's importance towards our friendship:<br>
=> Simply counting the month over its normal range provides functionality even after 2017's end!
